## Testing

All tests are run in parallel.

Download dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run all tests:

```bash
$ python test.py
```

Run all tests for a specific package, such as Project Euler:

```bash
$ python test.py project_euler
```

Run the test for a specific module, such as Project Euler Problem 1:

```bash
$ python test.py project_euler.p001
```
