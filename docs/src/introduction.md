# Project Euler Solutions

These are my coded solutions and explanations for problems from
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

In each you will find a brute-force solution and steps to improve
it. The problems are inherently mathematical and the explanations for
the more optimal solutions necessitate delving into number theory. I
have tried to explain concepts from the ground up, though some
familiarity with mathematical notation will be useful.

Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the explanations are
accurate and correct, you are encouraged to raise an issue on the
[source repository](https://github.com/kwyse/euler-solutions) if you
find a mistake. If you know this fix, a PR would be even better! Many
thanks in advance.
