# Problem 001

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

We can solve this by iterating from one to one thousand, filtering out numbers that are multiples of three or five, and summing the remaining numbers. Let's implement something along those lines.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let result = (1..1_000)
        .filter(|n| [3, 5].iter().any(|m| n % m == 0))
        .sum::<u32>();

    println!("{}", result);
}
```

Try it out. It runs in the order of microseconds with these inputs. This implementation is simple, demonstrates the intention, and runs in \\( O(n) \\) time with respect to the limit, which is \\( 1000 \\) here. However, we can improve the run time by about a thousand times with some number theory.

## Gauss and Sequence Summation

Guass' method of summing a sequence of numbers starting with \\( 1 \\) doesn't rely on iteration.

\\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2} \tag{1} \\]

To see why this works, let's look at when \\( n = 6\\).

\\[ \sum_{i=1}^{6} i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 \\]

For each number \\( x_i \\) up to \\( \frac{n}{2} \\), pair it with \\( x_{n-i+1} \\).

\\[ 1 + 6 = 7 \\]
\\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \\]
\\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\]

We have \\( \frac{n}{2} \\) pairs and each pair is equal to \\( 7 \\), or \\( n + 1 \\), hence our equation is \\( \frac{n}{2} \cdot (n + 1) \\) and equivalent to equation \\( (1) \\).

If \\( n \\) is odd, we won't be able to pair all of the numbers unless we include \\( 0 \\). Let's try this with \\( n = 7 \\).

\\[ 0 + 7 = 7 \\]
\\[ 1 + 6 = 7 \\]
\\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \\]
\\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\]

Now we have \\( \frac{n + 1}{2} \\) pairs but they all equal \\( n \\), so our equation is \\( \frac{n + 1}{2} \cdot n \\), which is also equivalent to equation \\( (1) \\). We can use mathematical induction to prove this for all natural numbers. To make our conclusions more general, lets include zero in our solution set, so we're trying to prove for any \\( n \\) in \\( \mathbb{N}_0 \\). First, we want to formally define our proposition.

\\[n \in \mathbb{N}_0 \\]
\\[0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\]

Now let's define the statement we want to prove.

\\[ \text{Let } P(n) \text{ be the statement } 0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\]

First we prove the base case. In this instance, our base case is when \\( n = 0 \\).

\\[
\begin{align}
P(0) & = \frac{0 \cdot (0 + 1)}{2} \\\ & = 0
\end{align}
\\]

Now we want to prove the inductive step. Let's introduce \\( k \\), where \\( k \geq 0 \\), and assume that \\( P(k) \\) holds given our proof of the base case. We now want to prove \\( P(k + 1) \\).

\\[
\begin{align}
P(k + 1) & = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + (k + 1) \\\ & = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + \frac{2(k + 1)}{2} \\\ & = \frac{k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1)}{2} \\\ & = \frac{k^{2} + k + 2k + 2}{2} \\\ & = \frac{k^{2} + 3k + 2}{2} \\\ & = \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2} \\\ & = \frac{(k + 1)((k + 1) + 1)}{2}
\end{align}
\\]

The last equation is of the form of equation \\( (1) \\), so this proves that our inductive step \\( P(k + 1) \\) also holds, and therefore \\( P(n) \\) holds for all all natural numbers. Let's implement this.

```rust,noplaypen
{{#include ../../src/p001.rs:17:19}}

assert_eq!(sum_to(6), 21);
assert_eq!(sum_to(7), 28);
```

Now we can sum sequences like like \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + \cdots + n \\), but our problem statement is asking for something different. Instead of each term in our sequence incrementing by \\( 1 \\), we want it increment by an arbitrary amount \\( x \\) that corresponds to the base of the multiples that we are summing. So for \\( x = 3 \\), we want \\( 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 \cdots + n \\). This should result in a lower answer, because we are including less terms in the sequence. It's simply a matter of dividing our inner \\( n \\) by \\( x \\) and taking the floor of this value.

\\[ \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor} xi = \dfrac{n(\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor + 1)}{2} \tag{2} \\]

So now we have the afformentioned multiples-of-three sequence and we can calculate \\( 5 + 10 + 15 + \cdots + n \\). But as you can see from looking at the sequences, we're including \\( 15 \\) twice, and we would also include all of its multiples up to \\( n \\). \\( 15 \\) is the product of all of the values in \\( xs \\), hence we must subtract the sum of the multiples of the product of the input set. This brings us to our solution.

```rust,noplaypen
# {{#include ../../src/p001.rs:17}}
# {{#include ../../src/p001.rs:18}}
# {{#include ../../src/p001.rs:19}}
#
{{#include ../../src/p001.rs:9:15}}
```

This solution allows us to generalise the problem statement.

> Given a set of numbers \\( xs \\), find the sum of all of the multiples of these numbers that are under a limit \\( n \\).

This solution also shows another way to think about equation \\( (2) \\). `sum_multiples_for_x` multiplies `sum_to` with the value of `x` because the sum should be `x` times larger than the sum of the sequence in Gauss' closed form. But because we still only want to sum values up to `n`, we divide the value we pass to `sum_to` by `x`.

This implementation runs in the order of nanoseconds.
