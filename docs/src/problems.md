# Problems

These solutions are implemented in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Rust hits a sweet spot between
performant and expressive code. Benchmarks are included that
illustrate the solutions are optimised beyond a naive
implementation. It is my hope that you will find the code clear and
concise.

Benchmarks are performed by the
[Criterion](https://crates.io/crates/criterion) library. Criterion
also generates the included reports and uses
[Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) under the hood to generate the
graphs.

[Clippy](https://crates.io/crates/clippy) is used to lint the
code. The build and deployment process is managed by [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/). You can find the source for the project
in its [repository on
GitHub](https://github.com/kwyse/euler-solutions).

This book itself is generated with
[mdBook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/) and hosted on
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
