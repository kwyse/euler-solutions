//! Problem 4: Largest palindrome product
//!
//! A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
//! from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
//!
//! Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

/// Finds the largest palindromic product within a range of numbers
///
/// For each number yielded in succession from the highest number to the lowest,
/// check if this number if divisible by _11_. All decimal palindromic numbers
/// with an even number of digits are divisble by _11_.
///
/// For example, for a six digit palindromic number _P_, with letters _x_, _y_,
/// and _z_ representing each of its six digits:
///
/// _P_
/// = 100000x + 10000y + 1000z + 100z + 10y + x
/// = 100001x + 10010y + 1100z
/// = 11(9091x + 910y + 100z)
///
/// Or for a four digit palindromic number:
///
/// _P_
/// = 1000x + 100y + 10y + x
/// = 1001x + 110y
/// = 11(91x + 10y)
///
/// If the yeilded number is not divisible by _11_, the other factor of the
/// potentially palindromic number is, so increment by _11_ in each inner loop
/// iteration. Within the inner loop, first check if the product is smaller than
/// the current largest found palindrome, and break early if so since subsequent
/// palindromes will always be smaller. If not, check if the product is a
/// palindrome by comparing it to its reversed value.
